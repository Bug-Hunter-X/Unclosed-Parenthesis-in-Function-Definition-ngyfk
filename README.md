# Unclosed Parenthesis in Function Definition

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily missed error in Python: an unclosed parenthesis in a function definition.  The error is subtle because it might not be immediately apparent where the syntax error is within a larger codebase.

The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `python bug.py`. Observe the `SyntaxError`.
4. Run `python bugSolution.py`. Observe successful execution.
